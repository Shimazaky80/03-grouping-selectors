# 03-grouping-selectors

Instead of having a single element with two different rules applied, instead, we're going to give two elements each a unique class name, then add rules for styles that both elements share as well as their own unique styles.

The properties that need to be added to each element are:

- The first element: a black background and white text
- The second element: a yellow background
- Both elements: a font size of 28px and a list of fonts containing Helvetica and Times New Roman, with sans-serif as a fallback
